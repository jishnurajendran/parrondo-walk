\section{Introduction}
Parrando's paradox consists of a sequence of games,individually each of them are losing games,provides a winning situation when played in a deterministic or random manner. It has been shown that Parrando's games have important applications in many physical and biological systems \cite{control}. Quantum version of parrando's games are introduced in \cite{flitney}- \cite{chandru}. Quantum version of classical random walk was first introduced in 1993 in \cite{1993}.


Here Parrando's games are explored using 1-Dimensional discrete time quantum walk(DTQW). When a game is played, the net expectation of position of walker is used to define winning and losing strategy. It has been already shown that Parrando's paradox does not exist in asymptotic limits in \cite{flitney},\cite{minli}.

\section{Motivation}
\section{Parrondo's game}
\label{pg}
In a game of chess, pieces can sometimes be
sacrificed in order to win the overall game.
Similarly, engineers know that two unstable
systems, if combined in the right way, can
paradoxically become stable. But can two
losing gambling games be set up such that,
when they are played one after the other,
they becoming winning? The answer is yes.
This is a striking new result in game theory
called Parrondo’s paradox, after its discoverer, Juan Parrondo
\par
\begin{figure}[H]

\emph{
 Game rules and simulation.  \textbf{a} , An example of two
games, consisting of only three biased coins, which demonstrate
Parrondo’s paradox, where $p_{1}$, $p_{2}$ and $p_{3}$ are the probabilities of winning for the individual coins.For a game $A$,if $\epsilon = 0.005$ and $p_{1}=1/2 - \epsilon $, then it is a losing game.For game $B$,if $p_{2}=1/10 - \epsilon $, $p_{3}=3/4 -\epsilon $ and $M=3$ then we end up with coin 3 more often that coin 2 .But coin 2 has a poor probability of winning, so $B$ is a losing game. The paradox is that playing games $A$
and $B$ in any sequence leads to a win.. \textbf{b}, The progress of playing
games $A$ and $B$ individually and when switching between them.
The simulation was performed by playing game A twice and game
B twice, and so on, until $100$ games were played; this is indicated
by the line labelled ‘Periodic’. Randomly switched games result in
the line labelled ‘Random’. The results were averaged from $50000$ trials with $\epsilon = 0.005$. }  }\label{parr}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
In Parrondo's game, in its usually form as a gambling game,
a single agent plays against a bank, with the choice of two games $A$ and $B$,
whose results are determined by the toss of biased coins.
Each of these games is losing when played in isolation
but when played alternately or in some other deterministic or random sequence
(such as $ABAB$, etc.) can become a winning game. Because of its anti-intuitive nature, Parrondo's games are also referred to as Parrondo's paradox.
Standard form of Parrondo's game involves games of chance. Two games, $A$ and $B$, when played individually, produce a losing expectation. An apparently paradoxical situation arises when the two games are played in an alternating order, a winning expectation is produced. The apparent paradox that two losing games $A$ and $B$ can produce a winning outcome when played in an alternating sequence was devised by Parrondo as a pedagogical illustration of the Brownian ratchet. However, Parrondo's games have important applications in many physical and biological systems, combining processes lead to counterintuitive dynamics. For example, in control theory, the combination of two unstable systems can cause them to become stable. In the theory of granular flow, drift can occur in a counterintuitive direction. Also, the switching between two transient diffusion processes in random media can form a positive recurrent process. There are actually many ways to construct such gambling scenarios, the simplest of which uses three biased coins.A model of such a game is presented in the Figure (\ref{parr}(a)).Game $A$ consists of tossing a biased
coin (coin 1) that has a probability ($p_{1}$)of
winning of less than half, so it is a losing
game. Let $p_{1}=1/2 - \epsilon $  where $\epsilon$, the bias, 
can be any small number, say $0.005$.Game $B$
 (\ref{parr}(a)) consists of playing
with two biased coins. The rule is that we
play coin $2$ if our capital is a multiple of an
integer $M$ and play coin $3$ if it is not. The
value of $M$ is not important, but for simplicity let us say that $M=3$. This means that, on average, coin 3 would be played a little more often than coin $2$. If we assign a
poor probability of winning to coin $2$, such
as $p_{2} = 1/10 -\epsilon $, then this would outweigh
the better coin 3 with $p_{3} = 3/4  - \epsilon$, making
game $B$ a losing game overall.\\
Thus both $A$ and $B$ are losing games, as
can be seen in Figure \ref{parr}b, where the two lower
lines indicate declining capital. If we play
two games of $A$ followed by two of $B$ and so
on, this periodic switching results in the
upper line in Figure. \ref{parr}b, showing a rapid
increase in capital — this is Parrondo’s paradox. What is even more remarkable is that
when games A and B are played randomly,
with no order in the sequence, this still produces a winning expectation (Fig.\ref{parr}b).

\section{Parrondo's game using DTQW}
\label{pgqw}

Parrondo's games arise in the situation when we have two
games that are losing when played seperately, but the two games played
in combination will form an overall winning game.
\par
 \begin{figure}[h]

\includegraphics[scale =0.7]{winloss}
\par\end{centering}

\caption{\emph{Pictorial illustration of the conditions for win or loss for QWs on
a line.}}
\label{fig:win-loss}
\end{figure}
Consider two games A and B,there are two ways to approach the parrondo's game in DTQW,First one, two games are alternatively played
according to the time and other one in the position.
Here we consider the second approach, i.e.,alternating in position.
\par
For the following quantum walk we consider $SU(2)$ matrix 
\begin{equation}
U_{\alpha,\beta,\gamma}^{S}=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
e^{i\alpha}\cos\beta & -e^{-i\gamma}\sin\beta\\
e^{i\gamma}\sin\beta & e^{-i\alpha}\cos\beta
\end{array}\right),\label{eq:SU(2)}
\end{equation}
instead of Hadamard operator 

The game is constructed as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Both game A and B are represented by different quantum operators $U(\alpha_{A},\beta_{A},\gamma_{A})$
and $U(\alpha_{B},\beta_{B},\gamma_{B})$.
\item The state is in $\mid\Psi_{0}\rangle=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\mid n=0\rangle(\mid 0\rangle+i\mid 0\rangle)$
initially.
\item Game \emph{A} and \emph{B} are played alternately in different positions
in one step, instead of step by step. i.e. game A is played on site
$x=nq$ and game B is played on site $x\neq nq$. The evolution operator
can be written as:
\begin{equation}
U=\sum_{x=nq,n\in Z}\hat{S}_{x}U(\alpha_{A},\beta_{A},\gamma_{A})+\sum_{x\neq nq,n\in Z}\hat{S}_{x}U(\alpha_{B},\beta_{B},\gamma_{B}),
\end{equation}
where $q$ is the period, $n$ is an integer, and the final state
after $N$ steps is given by
\begin{equation}
\mid\Psi_{N}\rangle=U^{N}\mid\Psi_{0}\rangle.
\end{equation}
For $q=3$, it means we play games with the sequence ABBABB on the
line.
\end{itemize}
As denoted in Fig. \ref{fig:win-loss}, after $N$ steps, if the probability
$P_{R}$ of the walker to be found in the right of the origin, is
greater than the probability $P_{L}$ in the left of the origin, that
is $P_{R}-P_{L}>0$, we consider the player win $P_{R}-P_{L}$. Similarly,
if $P_{R}-P_{L}<0$, the player losses $P_{L}-P_{R}$. If $P_{R}-P_{L}=0$,
it means the player neither losses nor wins.

\caption{\emph{An example for different games and there probability distribution,we can see the red one favors right,green one left,blue dashed one to right and dashed one to left. }}
\label{fig:game}
\end{figure}
By making use of above scheme we have constructed Parrondo's games by using the one-dimensional
discrete time quantum walks. The game is constructed by two lossing
games \emph{A} and \emph{B} with two different biased coin operators
$U_{A}(\alpha_{A},\beta_{A},\gamma_{A})$ and $U_{B}(\alpha_{B},\beta_{B},\gamma_{B})$. With a
number of selections of $\alpha_{A},\beta_{A},\gamma_{A},\alpha_{B},\beta_{B},\gamma_{B}$,
we can form a winning game with sequences \emph{ABB, ABBB}, \emph{et
al}. If we set $\beta_{A}=45,\gamma_{A}=0,\alpha_{B}=0,\beta_{B}=88$,
we find the \emph{game 1 }with $U_{A}^{S}=U^{S}(-51,45,0)$, $U_{B}^{S}=U^{S}(0,88,-16)$
will win most. If we set $\alpha_{A}=0,\beta_{A}=45,\alpha_{B}=0,\beta_{B}=88$,
the \emph{game 2} with $U_{A}^{S}=U^{S}(0,45,-51)$, $U_{B}^{S}=U^{S}(0,88,-67)$
will win most. And \emph{game 1 }is equivalent to the \emph{game}
\emph{2 }with the changes of sequences and steps. But at a large enough
steps, the game will loss.

\section{Entangled Quantum Walk}
\subsection{Mathematical Structure of Quantum Walks on an Infinite Line Using
a Maximally Entangled Coin}

As before, the elements of an unrestricted quantum walk on a line
are a walker, a coin, evolution operators for both coin and walker,
and a set of observables. We shall provide a detailed description of
each element motivated by the previous subsection.

\noindent\emph{\textbf{Walker and Coin:}}  The walker is, as in the
unrestricted quantum walk with a single coin, a quantum system
$|\text{position}\rangle$ residing in a Hilbert space of infinite
but countable dimension ${\cal H}_P$. The canonical basis states $|i
\rangle_P$ that span ${\cal H}_P$, as well as any superposition 
of the form $\sum_{i} \alpha_i|i\rangle_p$ subject to
$\sum_i|\alpha_i|^2 = 1$, are valid states for the walker.
The walker is usually initialized at the \lq origin' i.e.
$|\text{position}\rangle_0 = |0\rangle_P$.

The coin is now an entangled system of two qubits i.e. a quantum
system living in a 4-dimensional Hilbert space ${\cal H}_{EC}$. 
We denote coin initial states as $|\text{coin}\rangle_0$. Also, 
we shall use the following Bell states as coin initial states 
\begin{subequations}
\begin{equation}\label{bell1}
|\Phi^+\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|00\rangle + |11\rangle)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{bell2}
|\Phi^-\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|00\rangle - |11\rangle)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{bell3}
|\Psi^+\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|01\rangle + |10\rangle)
\end{equation}
\end{subequations}
which are maximally entangled pure bipartite states with reduced von
Neumann entropy equal to unity. We shall examine the consequences of
employing such maximally entangled states by comparing the resulting
walks with those resulting from using maximally correlated coins in
classical random walks. The Bell singlet state $|\Psi^-\rangle =
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|01\rangle - |10\rangle)$ is not employed as an
entangled coin as it is left invariant when the same local unitary
operator is applied to both coins.


The total initial state of the quantum walk resides in the Hilbert space
${\cal H}_T = {\cal H}_P \otimes {\cal H}_{EC}$ and has the form
\begin{equation}
|\psi\rangle_0 = |\text{position}\rangle_0 \otimes
|\text{coin}\rangle_0
\end{equation}

\noindent\emph{\textbf{Entanglement measure:}}
In order to quantify the degree of entanglement of the coins
used in this paper, we shall employ the reduced von Neumann entropy
measure. For a pure quantum state $| \psi \rangle$ of a composite
system $AB$ with $\text{dim}(A) = d_A$ and $\text{dim}(B) = d_B$,
let $|\psi \rangle = \sum_{i=1}^d \alpha_i |i_A\rangle |i_B\rangle$,
($d$ = min($d_A$,$d_B$), $\alpha_i \geq 0$ and $\sum_{i=1}^d \alpha_i^2 = 1$) be its
Schmidt decomposition. Also, let $\rho_A = \text{tr}_B(|\psi\rangle \langle \psi|)$
and $\rho_B = \text{tr}_A(|\psi\rangle \langle \psi|)$ be the reduced density
operators of systems $A$ and $B$ respectively. {\it The entropy of entanglement}
$E(|\psi\rangle)$ is the von Neumann entropy of the reduced density operator %\cite{bennett96}

\begin{equation}
E(|\psi\rangle) = S(\rho_A) = S(\rho_B) = - \sum_{i=1}^d \alpha_i^2 \log_2 (\alpha_i^2).
\label{von_neumann}
\end{equation}
$E$ is a monotonically-increasing function of the entanglement present in the system
$AB$. A non-entangled state has $E=0$.
States $|\psi\rangle \in {\cal H}^d$ for which $E(\psi) = d$ are called {\it maximally
entangled states} in $d$ dimensions. In particular, note that
for those quantum states described by Eqs. (\ref{bell1}),
(\ref{bell2}) and (\ref{bell3}) 
$E(|\Phi^+\rangle) = E(|\Phi^-\rangle) = E(|\Psi^+\rangle) = 1$,
i.e. these states are maximally entangled.



\noindent\emph{\textbf{Evolution Operators:}}  The evolution
operators used are more complex than those for quantum walks with
single coins. As in the single coin case, the only requirement
evolution operators must fulfill is that of unitarity.

Let us start by defining evolution operators for an entangled coin.
Since the coin is a bipartite system, its evolution operator is
defined as the tensor product of two single-qubit coin operators:
\begin{equation}
\hat{C}_{EC} = \hat{C} \otimes \hat{C}
\end{equation}
For example, we could define the operator $\hat{C}_{EC}^H$ as the
tensor product $\hat{H}^{\otimes 2}$:
\begin{equation}\label{hadamard_tensor}
\begin{split}
\hat{C}_{EC}^H = & {1 \over 2}(|00\rangle \langle 00| + |01\rangle
\langle 00| + |10\rangle
\langle 00| + |11\rangle \langle 00| \\
& + |00\rangle \langle 01| - |01\rangle \langle 01| + |10\rangle
\langle 01| -
|11\rangle \langle 01| \\
& + |00\rangle \langle 10| + |01\rangle \langle 10| - |10\rangle
\langle 10| -
|11\rangle \langle 10| \\
& + |00\rangle \langle 11| - |01\rangle \langle 11| - |10\rangle
\langle 11| + |11\rangle \langle 11|).
\end{split}
\end{equation}
An alternative bipartite coin operator is produced by computing the
tensor product $\hat{Y}^{\otimes 2}$ where $\hat{Y}
=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle \langle 0| + i|0\rangle \langle 1|+
i|1\rangle \langle 0| + |1\rangle \langle 1|)$, namely
%$Y =\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{pmatrix} 1 & i\\ i & 1\end{pmatrix}$:
\begin{equation}\label{y_tensor}
\begin{split}
\hat{C}_{EC}^Y = & {1 \over 2} ( |00\rangle \langle 00| +
i|01\rangle \langle 00| + i|10\rangle
\langle 00| - |11\rangle \langle 00| \\
& + i|00\rangle \langle 01| + |01\rangle \langle 01| - |10\rangle
\langle 01|
+ i|11\rangle \langle 01| \\
& + i|00\rangle \langle 10| - |01\rangle \langle 10| + |10\rangle
\langle 10|
+ i|11\rangle \langle 10| \\
& - |00\rangle \langle 11| + i|01\rangle \langle 11| + i|10\rangle
\langle 11| + |11\rangle \langle 11|).
\end{split}
\end{equation}


Both coin operators are fully separable, thus any entanglement
in the coins is due to the initial states used.


The conditional shift operator $\hat{S}_{EC}$ necessarily allows the
walker to move either forwards or backwards along the line,
depending on the state of the coin. The operator

\begin{equation}\label{shift_operator_two_spins}
\begin{split}
{\hat S}_{EC} = |00\rangle_{cc} \langle 00| \otimes \sum_i |i+1
\rangle_{pp}
\langle i| \\
+ |01\rangle_{cc} \langle 01| \otimes \sum_i |i\rangle_{pp} \langle i| \\
+ |10\rangle_{cc} \langle 10| \otimes \sum_i |i\rangle_{pp} \langle i|\\
+ |11\rangle_{cc} \langle 11| \otimes \sum_i |i-1 \rangle_{pp}
\langle i|
\end{split}
\end{equation}
embodies the stochastic behaviour of a classical random walk with a
maximally correlated coin pair. It is only when both coins reside in
the $|00\rangle$ or $|11\rangle$ state that the walker moves either
forwards or backwards along the line; otherwise the walker does not
move.

Note that $\hat{S}_{EC}$ is one of a family of valid definable shift
operators. Indeed, it might be troublesome to identify a classical
counterpart for some of these operators: their existence is uniquely
quantum-mechanical in origin. One such alternative operator is
\begin{equation}\label{shift_operator_s2}
\begin{split}
{\hat S}_{EC}' = |00\rangle_{cc} \langle 00| \otimes \sum_i |i+2
\rangle_{pp}
\langle i| \\
+ |01\rangle_{cc} \langle 01| \otimes \sum_i |i+1\rangle_{pp} \langle i| \\
+ |10\rangle_{cc} \langle 10| \otimes \sum_i |i-1\rangle_{pp} \langle i|\\
+ |11\rangle_{cc} \langle 11| \otimes \sum_i |i-2 \rangle_{pp}
\langle i|.
\end{split}
\end{equation}

The total evolution operator has the structure ${\hat U}_T = {\hat
S_{EC}}.({\hat C_{EC}} \otimes \mathbb{{\hat I}}_p)$ and a succint
mathematical representation of a quantum walk after $N$ steps is 
$|\psi \rangle = ({\hat U}_T)^N |\psi\rangle_0$, where $|\psi\rangle_0$
denotes the initial state of the walker and the coin.\\
\noindent\emph{\textbf{Observables:}} The observables defined here
are used to extract information about the state of the quantum walk
$| \psi \rangle = ({\hat U}_T)^N |\psi\rangle_0$.

We first perform measurements on the coin using the observable
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
{\hat M}_{EC} = \beta_{00} |00\rangle_{cc}\langle 00| + \beta_{01}
|01\rangle_
{cc}\langle 01|\\
\beta_{10} |10\rangle_{cc}\langle 10|+\beta_{11}
|11\rangle_{cc}\langle 11|.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Measurements are then performed on the position states using the
operator
\begin{equation}
{\hat M}_P = \sum_j b_j |j\rangle_{PP}\langle j|.
\end{equation}

With the purpose of introducing the results presented
in the rest of this paper we compare in Table 1 the 
actual position probability values for a classical random walk
on an infinite line (Eq. (\ref{prob_dist_crw})), and a
quantum walk with initial state $|\Phi^+\rangle = {1 \over \sqrt{2}}(|00\rangle + |11\rangle)$
and coin and shift operators given by Eqs. (\ref{hadamard_tensor})
and (\ref{shift_operator_two_spins}), respectively.

In order to investigate the properties of unrestricted quantum walks
with entangled coins, we have computed several simulations using
bipartite maximally entangled coin states described by Eqs.~

operators described by Eqs. (\ref{hadamard_tensor}) and
(\ref{y_tensor}). In all cases, the initial position state of the
walker corresponds to the origin, i.e. $|\text{position}\rangle_0 =
|0\rangle$. The shift operator employed is that of Eq.~(\ref{shift_operator_two_spins}).

Let us first discuss the quantum walks whose graphs are shown in
Fig.~(\ref{figure2}). The initial entangled coin state is given by
Eq.~(\ref{bell1}) and the number of steps is $100$. For the red plot 
in Fig.~(\ref{figure2}) the coin operator is given by Eq.~(\ref{hadamard_tensor}),
while for the dotted blue plot in the same Fig.~(\ref{figure2})
the coin operator is that of Eq.~(\ref{y_tensor}).

The first notable property of these quantum walks is that, unlike
the classical case in which the most probable location of the walker
is at the origin and the probability distribution has a single peak,
in the quantum case a certain range of very likely positions about
the position $|0\rangle$ is evident but in addition there are a
further two regions at the extreme zones of the walk in which it is
likely to find the particle. This is the \lq three peak zones'
property of the shift operator defined in this way. 
The \lq three peak zones' property could mean an additional
advantage of quantum walks over classical random walks. 


We also note that the probability of finding the walker in the most
likely position, $|0\rangle$, is much higher in the quantum case
($\sim 0.171242$ in red plot of Fig.~(\ref{figure2}) and $\sim 0.221622$
in dotted blue plot of Fig.~(\ref{figure2})) than in the classical
case $(\sim 0.0795)$. Incidentally, we find that the use of different
coin initial states maintains the basic structure of the probability
distribution, unlike the quantum walk with a single coin in which
the use of different coin initial states can lead to different probability
distributions.

The position probability distributions shown in Fig.~(\ref{figure2})
could embody some advantages when used in an appropriate
application framework. For example, let us suppose we want
to design algorithms whose purpose is to find the wrong values
in a proposed solution of a problem (a concrete case is
to find all wrong binary values assigned to the initial
conditions of the algorithm used in to
find a solution to the 3-SAT problem.) 
We use a $100$-steps classical random walk (Fig.~(\ref{Fig:1}))
to design algorithm $C$ and a $100$-steps quantum walk with maximally
entangled coins (red plot of Fig.~(\ref{figure2})) to design algorithm $Q$. 

Depending on the actual number of wrong values, the probability 
distribution of red plot of Fig. (\ref{figure2}) could help to
make algorithm $Q$ faster than algorithm $C$. For example, if
the number of wrong values is in the range $40$ - $70$,
the probability of finding the quantum walker of 
Fig. (\ref{figure2}) is much higher than finding the classical
walker. Actual probability values
(note the differences in orders of magnitude)  are shown in Table 4.
It must be noted that employing a quantum walk
on a line with a single coin for building algorithm $Q$ would also 
produce higher probability values than a classical random walk in
those positions shown in Table 4, thus the choice of quantum walk
could depend on some other factors like implementation feasibility.

A consequence of the previous two properties of the quantum walk is
a sharper and narrower peak in the probability distribution around
position $|0\rangle$. Again, this may be of some advantage depending
on the application of the quantum walk (for example, less dispersion
around the most likely solution to the computational problem posed
in the two previous paragraphs).


The probability distributions for quantum walks in
Fig.~(\ref{figure3}) are very similar in structure to those of Fig.~
(\ref{figure2}), the only difference being the number of steps (200
as opposed to 100). For Fig.~(\ref{figure3}) the initial entangled
coin state is given by Eq.~(\ref{bell1}). Eq.~(\ref{hadamard_tensor})
is used as the coin operator in the red plot of Fig.~(\ref{figure3})
whereas Eq.~(\ref{y_tensor}) is the coin operator for the dotted blue
plot of Fig.~(\ref{figure3}). For $200$ steps the peaks on both
extreme zones are smaller than for $100$ steps, the reason being
the increased number of small probabilities that correspond to
those regions between the extreme peaks and the central peak.
A wider region is covered in the case of $200$ steps than for
$100$ steps.



Finally we would like to emphasize that in startling contrast to the
probability distributions of the classical case in which only
certain walker positions have a probability different from zero,
namely those positions whose parity is that of the total number of
steps, in the quantum cases presented in this paper we observe no
such constraint on the numerical data produced.
As stated in the introduction, the dynamics of
classical random walks can remove the parity constraint
by permitting the use of \lq rest sites' at the expense of
varying the amount of correlation between the coins.
\section{Quantum Walk with a partially entangled state}
What happens when one uses a partially entangled state $\psi=\cos(\gamma/2)|10>+i\sin(\gamma/2)|01>$, with $\gamma=\pi/2$ is max entanglement while gamma = pi  and 0 are product states.

If one considers at $AAA ..$ for first coin 1 and $BBB.. $ for coin 2 the difference between the probability to shift to right as agaisnt left is  $pr-pl$ is negative but for $ABAB...$  for coin 1 and  $BABA...$  for coin 2 the difference in right and left probability $pr-pl4$ is positive.
